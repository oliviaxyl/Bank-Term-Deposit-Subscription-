#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to target potential customers for bank term deposit subscription.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering 
* Crosstab and Dummy Coding 
* Predictive Modeling
* Scoring and KS test

### Technologies
* SAS

## Project Description

### Data 

* The dataset was obtained from the University of Californiaâ€™s Machine Learning Repository. 

* The particular dataset for this project is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset is relevant with 17 campaigns from May 2008 to November 2010 and it demonstrates the details of each contract the bank offered to the clients.

* 41,188 customer records by 20 attributes.

### Results

Select a reasonable cutoff level that separates the customers most efficiently - Score 550. More specifically, 60.6% of the term deposit subscribers scored above 550, while 12.9% of the non-subscribers scored above 550. With a cutoff of 550, 18.21% of the total population will be selected into target customer group as potential subscriber of the term deposit. Among selected customers, 37.22% of the campaigned customers are expected to accept the offer. Without using our model, only 11.27% of the campaigned customers would subscribe the term deposit.

## Future Work

Monitoring report step can be implemented to check the performance of prediction model. The differences between the predicted score distribution from our model and the actual score distribution is one of indicators to monitor the performance of the model. Since the changes in bank policies, social and economic environments might affect the performances of the model, therefore, monthly evaluation of current model through the table provided below is recommended.
