Direct marketing is a “target” marketing that aim to make the recipient to response and take action. Unlike usual mass advertising, which is presented to unspecific individuals, direct marketing is offered only to the people who are likely to have an interest and need the goods/ services. Then, it is a critical key recognizing the right target group to enhance marketing efficiency; minimizing the marketing cost and maximizing the response rate. 

Our model for bank direct marketing is to predict whether customers will subscribe the deposits with the bank by identifying potential customers. Based on the model analysis, bank can manage the marketing methods such as number of contact, interval of contacts, or selection of recipients. Additionally, bank can alleviate the risks of adverse effect of marketing from the groups who do not want to receive advertising by not contacting them. Hence, this model that can forecast the likelihood of deposit subscriptions can be profitable to the banks for improving their marketing campaign strategies.
